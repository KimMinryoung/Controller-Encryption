# Controller-Encryption

Controller-Encryption library provides C++ modules to build an encrypted control system of a linear SISO controller.

The main goal of this library is to give designers an easy way to implement their control system into encrypted one and simulate its performance.

This library is composed of encrypted system builder, LWE-encrypter, encrypted controller, sensor, actuator, and system simulation codes.
